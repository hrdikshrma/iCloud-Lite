## Installation

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- pip
- MySQL or SQLite (for database)
- AWS account for S3, EC2, and other services

**Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/hrdikshrma/iCloud-Lite.git
```

**Set Up Virtual Environment**
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Install Dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration

**Database Setup (MySQL)**
- In your MySQL instance, create a new database:
```
CREATE DATABASE cloud_drive_db;
```
- Update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'cloud_drive_db',
        'USER': 'your_mysql_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',  # Or your MySQL host
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```
- Run migrations:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

**AWS S3 Configuration**
- Set up an **S3 bucket** for file storage.
- Add your **AWS credentials** and **S3 bucket** name to `settings.py`:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your-access-key'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-secret-access-key'
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'  # e.g., us-east-1
```
- Ensure that CORS and bucket policies are set up in your S3 console to allow file uploads from your app.

**Other Settings** 

Update any other necessary settings in `settings.py`, such as `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, static file storage, and security settings.
## Usage

**Running the Development Server**
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the application locally. 

**NOTE: Please make additional changes if you are running this on the EC2 instance.**

## Deployment

**Deploying on AWS EC2**
- Launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Console.
- SSH into the EC2 instance and install dependencies.
- Set up your project on EC2 and configure it with your Elastic - IP and Load Balancer.
- Deploy your Django application using *Gunicorn* or *Nginx* for production.
## AWS Integration


- **Amazon S3:** Used to store user-uploaded files. Configured with proper bucket policies and CORS settings to allow secure uploads and downloads.
- **Amazon EC2:** The application is hosted on an EC2 instance. Deployed using *Elastic IP* to ensure a stable, fixed IP address.

- **Application Load Balancer:** AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is used to ensure high availability by distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
